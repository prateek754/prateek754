Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Alberta, studying auditory cognition and perception in songbirds at the [Songbird Neuroethology Lab](https://sites.psych.ualberta.ca/songbirdneuroethologylab/). My work has focused on automated classification of bird calls, with an emphasis on biologically significant acoustic features. I am currently expanding my expertise in bioacoustic analysis using R, Python, Praat, and Audacity, while also exploring Bayesian statistics and enhancing my data visualization skills.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate for developing automated acoustic complexity measurement tools for classification, with the aim of using the output in experimental research.
