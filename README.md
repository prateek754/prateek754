I'm PhD Candidate at University of Alberta, working on auditory cognition, and perception in songbirds at [Songbird Neuroethology Lab](https://sites.psych.ualberta.ca/songbirdneuroethologylab/). 
I've worked on automated classification of bird calls, focusing on biologically relevant acoustic features. I'm currently learning various automated bioacoustic methods in R, Python, Praat, and Audacity. Also learning and working on Bayesian statistics and data visualization.
